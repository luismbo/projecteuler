Given a h*w square each solution will consist in a sequence of h "go
down" actions and w "go right" actions. The solution is therefore
determined by how many ways we can combine said actions. We want the
number of "permutations with repetition of indistinguishable objects".

In this specific case that's (h*w)!/h!*w!.
Concretely: 40!/(20!*20!) = 137846528820.
